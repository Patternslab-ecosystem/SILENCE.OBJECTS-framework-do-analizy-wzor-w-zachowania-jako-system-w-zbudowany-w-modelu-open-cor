# SILENCE.OBJECTS: S11 Core Manifesto

## Principles
1. **Structural Neutrality:** Objects are records of interactions, never representations of human identity.
2. **Language Sterility:** All descriptions must use non-clinical, structural language (S11 Standard).
3. **Four-Phase Protocol:** Analysis must follow the sequence: Context -> Tension -> Meaning -> Function.

## Data Governance
- This framework enforces strict separation between the "Recording Layer" (PatternLens) and the "Interpretation Layer" (Engine).
- Private implementations (Enterprise) may add proprietary safety layers not included in this public core.
