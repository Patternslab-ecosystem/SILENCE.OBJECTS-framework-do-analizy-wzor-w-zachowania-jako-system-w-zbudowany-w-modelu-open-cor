## SILENCE.OBJECTS Manifesto

SILENCE.OBJECTS is not a wellbeing app, therapy tool, or diagnostic system. It is **infrastructure for structural analysis of behavioral patterns** – built for people who live and work in conditions of neurodiversity and information overload, and who need clear structure rather than promises of “transformation”.

We make a few non‑negotiable commitments:

- **Objects, not people**  
  The system works on Objects: discrete recordings of experience or interaction. An Object is never a label for a person, diagnosis, or trait. It is a unit of structure that can be examined, re‑examined, and discarded.

- **Hypotheses, not truth**  
  Every interpretation is a structural hypothesis, not a fact. Reports expose Context, Tension, Meaning, and Function, but never claim to “reveal who you are” or “what you should do”. The user keeps full authority over meaning and decisions.

- **No advice, no diagnosis, no recommendations**  
  SILENCE.OBJECTS does not offer therapeutic guidance, coping strategies, or medical judgement. The system never tells anyone what to feel, choose, or fix. It describes patterns; it does not prescribe action.

- **Language is structural, not clinical**  
  All modules follow the S11 language standard. We use engineering terms – patterns, sequences, rhythms, capacity signals, attention profiles – and avoid clinical, spiritual, or emotional labelling. Guardrails are enforced in code, contracts, and runtime.

- **Open‑core for builders, closed Engine for responsibility**  
  The foundational layer – type and event contracts, pattern modules, language guardrails, design system, and the reference PatternLens client – is open‑core under MIT. Teams can build their own tools on top of a clear, audited framework.  
  The SILENCE Engine and enterprise modules remain closed: this is where AI orchestration, prediction, governance, and audit live. Responsibility for people, teams, and institutions sits in this layer.

- **Limited‑risk by design**  
  The framework is designed for EU AI Act limited‑risk and GDPR compliance from day zero. We focus on structural data (sequences, rhythms, cycles, capacity), not sensitive diagnoses or emotional states. Safety profiles, consent flows, and auditability are part of the architecture, not optional add‑ons.

- **User control over time**  
  For individuals, tools like PatternLens are built to increase visibility over time – more history, more structure, more ways to export and reflect – without creating dependency or “care promises”. The user can always export, delete, or step away.

- **Transparent boundaries for organizations**  
  For teams and institutions, PatternsLab and Portal expose only aggregated, anonymized structural signals, never health classifications or ranking of individuals. Contracts, documentation, and runtime controls make those boundaries explicit and enforceable.

If you are here as a developer or researcher, you get a coherent, opinionated open‑core that you can use without adopting any therapeutic or medical framing.  
If you are here as an investor or partner, you get a platform whose moat is not just features, but **contracts, language sterility, and compliance baked into the core**.

This repository is the single source of truth for those commitments. Any implementation that crosses these boundaries is not SILENCE.OBJECTS‑compliant.
