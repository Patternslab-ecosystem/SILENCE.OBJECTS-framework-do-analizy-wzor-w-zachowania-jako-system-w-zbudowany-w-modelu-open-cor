# SILENCE.OBJECTS — Framework Manifest v4.0 (2026)

## Vision
A modular, composable framework for structural analysis of behavioral patterns. 
"Redesign the day, not the human."

## Core Principles
1. **Infrastructure First**: This is a substrate, not an end-user application.
2. **S11 Compliance**: Mandatory structural language guardrails.
3. **Open-Core Hybrid**: Clear split between @silence/* (MIT) and ee/* (Proprietary).

## The Map (SSOT)
- **@silence/contracts**: The Ontology.
- **@silence/core**: The 4-Phase Engine (Context → Tension → Meaning → Function).
- **@silence/language**: The S11 Enforcer.
- **@silence/sdk**: The Public Facade.

## Out of Scope (Proprietary)
- Predictive analytics, Safety P0, AI-Gateway, and Voice-to-Pattern extraction reside in ee/* and separate private repositories.
