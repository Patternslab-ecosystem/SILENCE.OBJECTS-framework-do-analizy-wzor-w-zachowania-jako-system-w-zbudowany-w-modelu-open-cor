# SILENCE.OBJECTS – Framework Abstract
SILENCE.OBJECTS is an open‑core framework for structural analysis of behavioral patterns, with an explicit non‑clinical scope. It defines:
- a typed contract layer for behavioral objects and events (`@silence/contracts`),
- a modular analysis layer implementing a four‑phase protocol (`@silence/core`),
- a set of behavioural modules (sequences, rhythms, cognitive load, capacity recovery, attention profiles),
- language and configuration guardrails (`@silence/language`, `@silence/validator`),
- and reference UIs for individual, team and governance‑level interaction.
