## @silence/contracts — Overview

Version: 1.0  
Role: central type and event contract (Single Source of Truth) for the entire SILENCE.OBJECTS ecosystem.

### Module purpose

- Defines **shared TypeScript types** for:
  - Objects, events, attention profiles, metrics, and related structures.
- Acts as the single place from which:
  - applications (`apps/*`), open‑core modules, and Engine modules (`ee/*`) import their types.
- Contains no business logic, only **contracts**:
  - interfaces, enums, type aliases.

### Package structure

`packages/@silence/contracts/`

- `src/index.ts` – public barrel export for all types.
- `src/events.ts` – event definitions (e.g. `BehavioralEvent`, `WearableEvent`, `ConsentEvent`).
- `src/objects.ts` – Object structure (entry point for PatternLens / PatternsLab).
- `src/profiles.ts` – attention profiles and UI configuration types.
- `src/metrics.ts` – core metric / signal types.

### Usage rules

- All other packages:
  - depend on `@silence/contracts` via `"@silence/contracts": "workspace:*"`.
- **No duplication** of types in other packages:
  - if you need a new type, add it here and release a new version of `@silence/contracts`.
- The module must not introduce language that violates S11:
  - type and field names must stay structural (pattern, cycle, tension, attentionProfile), with no clinical terminology.

### Minimal starter code (`index.ts`)

```ts
// packages/@silence/contracts/src/index.ts

export * from "./objects";
export * from "./events";
export * from "./profiles";
export * from "./metrics";
```
